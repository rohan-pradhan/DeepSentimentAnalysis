"""Trump Offers To Donate $5 Million To Charity If Obama Releases College Transcripts"" http://t.co/8l3BpZf6 via @rcpvideo",P
@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.,N
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.,N
"@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.",N
.@Mark_Sanchez shouldnâ€™t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.  He will always do great!,P
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.,N
